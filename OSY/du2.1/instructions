create :


start :
	1) Load the first overhead
		a) Failed? Okay, write a failed device and change state.
		b) Failed the second time? Okay, stop everything and clean up.
		c) Success? Okay, store the first in an oh1 variable.
	2) Continue doing (1):
		a) oh1 != read one? Store it in an oh2 var. 
		b) oh1 == read one? Give a vote.
		c) Failed? 1.a or 1.b
	3) Compare votes and write down a failed drive to MainRAID. 
	4) Set caches for all non-broken devices.
	5) Read from good overheads FirstFreeSector.
	6) For every Overhead set mainRAID as a config field.
	7) Set Overheads for all Workers.
	8) Clean up.

read:
	1) 

write :
	1) Calculate a line the starting sector is in.
	2) Calculate how many lines the data will engage.
	3) Crop a number if it's higher than the available space.
	4) Read from disks a padding (if needed).
	5) Store data in buffers.
	6) Calculate parity.
	7) Write buffers to disks.
	8) Repeat (5) until all the data is written.
	9) When the last block is reached, read a tail from disks.
	10) Calculate parity.
	11) Write the last block.
	12) Return a number of bytes written.

	writeToCache:
		1) Read first line
		2) While written lines != (linesCount - 1)
			a) Compute pos0 (== 0 if not the first line)
			b) Compute pos1 (== (DEVS - 1) if not the last line)
			c) Write data to cache line from pos0 to pos1
			d) Compute parity
			e) If chunk is full then write to disks
			f) Check the status
		3) Read the last line
		4) Write data from 0 to pos1
		5) Compute parity
		6) Write to disks
		7) Check the status
		8) Return number of bytes written
